implementing firebase and moment.js
This assignment was pretty challenging. Moment gives us all the necessary functions but going through them to get the exact calculation does take work. The firebase connection seemed to be the easiest task for this project but this did teach me the importance of syntax as leaving off one # kept me getting an error message that took me a while to find. overall it was fun and very educating.
